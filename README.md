# CRUD GALLERY - THE PURE

This is a repository that does not have a display, so you will be tested on designing the gallery display yourself. This repository is based on **PHP** and **MySql**. Have fun working on the display :)

**Thank you for using THE PURE for your project**




## Installation With Clone

* Copy the link from the repo

* Go to the terminal in Visual Studio Code

* And write the following command in the terminal



```
git clone (link from the repositories drop here)
```


## Installation With Download

Create a folder in the `xampp -> htdocs` folder if you use **XAMPP**. Meanwhile, if you use **Laragon**, create a folder in the folder `Laragon -> www` and running the code in Visual Studio Code with turning on the **XAMPP** and **Laragon** applications. 
**I suggest using XAMPP if Laragon doesn't work**
